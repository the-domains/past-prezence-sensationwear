  Lots of stools out there. I love this one because it is super clean, not a
  mark on the beautiful fabric. Cardinals and Chickadees frolicking among the
  pine needles and birch trees. Sturdy, and so unique. The only flaw I find is
  the tiny split on the one brass foot which I have shown in the photos. This
  split will not get any worse as it is still intact.   The nice soft thick
  flannel will look great in any room in the house.  23 x 15 x 15
