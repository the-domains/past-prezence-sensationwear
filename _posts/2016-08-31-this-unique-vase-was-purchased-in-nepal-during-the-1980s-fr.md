  This unique vase was purchased in Nepal during the 1980's from a family whose
  farm I used to visit. The family lived a simple life and had simple treasures
  which they parted with because the children were more interested in the design
  of the West.....USA......well, I loved the treasures and will be listing some
  of them soon. Keep an eye out for them.  8 x 11" tall
