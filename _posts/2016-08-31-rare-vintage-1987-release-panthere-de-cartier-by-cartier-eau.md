  Rare vintage 1987 release Panthere de Cartier By Cartier Eau de Parfum 30 mL 1
  fl.oz spray perfume with original Cartier holder refillable! There is still
  enough parfum left to try it and fall in love!!!!  The scoop on Panthere de
  Cartier By Cartier:  The magical and sensible classical women perfume Panthere
  is maybe a bit old-fashioned, but still it is luxurious and unique. The woman
  who chooses it will get gentleness and warmth. In the top notes there is a
  citrus freshness of tangerine and grapefruit spiced with pepper and thin spicy
  note of ginger together with incense and rose. The heart bloomed with the
  abundance of exotic flower (jasmine, gardenia, tuberose, freesia, orris,
  narcissus and ylang-ylang) in which woodsy notes of vetiver and spicy note of
  nutmeg are melded in. In the base there are oak-moss, bean Tonka, patchouli,
  sandal, civet, musk, amber, vanilla and cedar. The perfume was made by Alberto
  Morillas in 1986.
