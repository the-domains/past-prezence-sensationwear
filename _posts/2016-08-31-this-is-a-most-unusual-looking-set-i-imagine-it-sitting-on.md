  This is a most unusual looking set. I imagine it sitting on a desk holding
  paperclips and maybe a stylus or 2, and then I imagine it holding some
  cigarettes and using the insert as an ashtray. It can hold loose change in the
  oval holder and jewelry in the insert. Or even your dressing table with a
  lipstick or 2 in the oval holder and a pair of earrings in the tray.  In
  perfect condition without any scratches or chips, and no mark anywhere to be
  found, but it does look alot like Cartier. Hmmmm?  4.75 x 3 x 2.75 tall
